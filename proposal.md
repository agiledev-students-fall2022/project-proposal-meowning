# Meowing Proposal

## Project Title: Albert Pro Max

## Members
Bernice Wu, Coulson Liang, Elaine Shan, Larry Li, Richard Xu

## What and Why
Students hate scrolling all the way down to the end of course lists and trying to lookup the prerequisites, time, and enroll status. They also have to search the web for ratings and syllabi. To make the course registration process easier for students, we want to build a online platform that allows students to easily gets the course information they have to spend days to look for. 

## For Whom
For our NYU brothers and sisters

## How
 1. track their course status (open, wl, closed) they marked intereted in
 2. rate courses they already took and upload syllabus for later users
 3. record their course standing, and provide future course options
 4. auto generate week schedule in PNG

# Scope
This project applies technology skills like web scraping, api interaction and database design that are all covered by NYU courses, which is suitable for undergraduate level. 


However, we may encounter following challenges:
1. A user-friendly front-end requires lots of designing and programming

2. Multiple data sources, need database management

3. Inlcudes innovating functions (e.g., course recommendation system) that are not seen in existsting platforms

4. Potential issues that come with web scrapping and event scheduler

Therefore, we anticipate that the project will roughly take 4-6 programmers.
